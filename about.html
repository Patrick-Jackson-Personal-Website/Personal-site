    <h2><u>Gaming</u></h2>
    <p>
        Gaming has been apart of my life for very long time. Although the stigma around playing video games has changed throughout the years,
        it has been consistent for me. I have created friendships and new experiences while gaming. I have learned some very valuble life skills, such as 
        working with others as a team. I have learned about my own competitive nature, and even how to stay calm in difficult situations. Another passion of mine is focusing on mental health, and gaming has been a way for me to 
        relieve stress as for many others. Some of my favorite games include the following :
        <ul>
            <li>Overwatch</li>
            <li>Tekken</li>
            <li>Call Of Duty</li>
            <li>Mortal Kombat</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<div class="fitness">
    <h2><u>Fitness</u></h2>
    <p>
        Another important aspect in my life is fitness. Fitness is freedom in terms of what the body can do.
        Having an active lifestyle creates a positive outlet to once again relieve stress and fortify the mind. I workout often throughout the week
        in order to build discipline and to feel alive. Fitness is also subjective, meaning 
        it does not have to be strict in terms of how you do it. Some of my favorite forms of fitness are :
        <ul>
            <li>Strength Training</li>
            <li>Cardio</li>
            <li>Yoga/Stretching</li>
            <li>Athletic Training</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
